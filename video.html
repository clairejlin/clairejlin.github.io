<h3>Title: What is that sound?</h3>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlyrztWvilk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I created a video that demonstrates a casual, mysterious plot of Jeremiah attempting to discover what the mysterious creaking sound was, especially a sound that woke him up from a nap. In this video, you see a visual of Jeremiah walking in his house trying to figure out what and where the creaking sound was coming from. He ends up looking for where the sound was coming from but the mysterious part is how the sound came about in this video. I also intended on creating a cliff hanger because of how some mystery shows on television make the viewers wait for the final reveal and to also create an interest in wanting the audience to watch the next episode.

This project was created at Jeremiah's house and with the right amount of space and room to film, this also created a great step by step mindset to figuring out what the sound was. I also felt inspired by cartoons that would also have a similar plot, like Tom and Jerry episodes. I wanted to include emotions of faces while trying to figure out what the mysterious sounds are. I personally also enjoy mysterious shows because it creates a journey to figuring out what happens next.</p>
