<h3>Title: 365 Days on Repeat</h3>

<p>After playing around with a few processing examples, I was able to eventually create a theme for this art piece. I decided to go for a theme in repetition and gave me an idea on what came into mind. WIth this idea, I thought of circular motions and wanted to create an interactive movement between the mouse and movement of interaction. I also used a cool tone for colors, like green and blue to setup an earthy vibe. In addition, my favorite inspiration for using this program was to have the opportunity to freely move around in this atmosphere. As a hidden factor, I was able to add a key press option, where if you pressed a random key, a sphere would show up in a random color. With a different colored sphere in a different place, you can see why I included the repetition of having different colored spheres, but in a repetitive area of interaction.

As for the circular rotation that creates an object, this is set in the center and is in a repetitive motion in a hourglass. I found this movement in relationship with time and how we experience a new hour every day, month, year, and so on. With this, it creates a continuous thought about how the hour restarts with a new one and eventually a new day. I also included the date for when people would view this because I wanted this to represent the effect of how this happens everyday. I felt like this was a great creative process to make because of how I was able to remind myself about a repetitive message. Overall, I found this piece fun to make and to also have the option to create a fun activity.</p>
