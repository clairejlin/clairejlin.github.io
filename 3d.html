<p>Throughout my 3D model, I decided to go for a playful environment, but in a chaotic field. The design and style has a nature and outdoor scenery and with colors and effects, i was able to create a glitch-like style to show that this is seen in a different dimension. I also aimed for a rare sighting for a crystal elephant to play in the snow. The crystal elephant is made up because of how the elephant looks with horns coming out of its back.

I was motivated to do a 3D model of nature and to create an environment you would not expect. I intended to use a chromatic aberration because of how this is in a different dimension of our world and to create something imaginable. With the virtual reality device, it feels like you are in the snow where the elephant is laying down after a long day of playing with the snow. You feel happiness and joy that the elephant brings, simply living its life. I personally love elephants and wanted to create a 3D model of something that could be significant for elephants.</p>
